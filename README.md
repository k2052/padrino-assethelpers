*ABANDONED/No Longer Maintained* but should still be functional

Asset tag helpers with support for asset hosts. Feature wise there is nothing new that cant be found elsewhere but I felt 
it was better to have the helpers in a separate gem. One doesn't always want or need to use stuff like sprockets. 
Originally I had kept these helpers in my padrino fork; there was no reason for that, I was just lazy.

Bits and pieces of both [https://github.com/Cirex/padrino-assets](Padrino-assets) and
[https://github.com/nightsailer/padrino-sprockets](Padrino-sprockets) can be found within this gem. Thanks guys!
